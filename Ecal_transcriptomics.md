+ Adapter trimming: Trim Galore! (Galaxy Version 0.6.7+galaxy0)
+ Alignment: BWA-MEM2 (Galaxy Version 2.2.1+galaxy4)
+ Count: featureCounts (Galaxy Version 2.0.3+galaxy2)
+ DEG analysis: edgeR (Galaxy Version 3.36.0+galaxy5)


## 4.1 DEGs  
Genes without more than 1 CPM in at least 6 samples are insignificant and filtered out.  
638 of 4579 (13.93%) genes were filtered out for low expression.  
TMM was the method used to normalise library sizes.
